Welcome to He Knows!
This game is a top-down perspective, surival horror game.
You are trapped in a mysterious building and must find a way to escape to the outside world,
armed only with a flashlight and your legs. Make it through to the end of the maze to win,
but watch your back, for who knows what lies in wait! Find a way to unlock the doors blocking
your path while evading any dangers that wait in the shadows

Have fun! Good luck!
